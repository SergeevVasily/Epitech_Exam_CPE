Epitech_Exam_CPE
================

Exercises of "C - Elem Prog" exams at Epitech.

The posted versions are such that I have made during the exams, so do not judge too harshly.

If you want to improve yourself for exams, first try to do the exercises without looking at the code.

## Difficulty
The number in front of the folder name indicates the difficulty of the exercise.

So, "0_aff_z" is realy easy and "1_rotone" is more harder.
